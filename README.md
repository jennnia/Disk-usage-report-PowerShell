# Disk-usage-report-PowerShell
ðŸŒŸ This PowerShell script analyzes disk usage in a specified directory (including its subdirectories) by calculating the total size of files grouped by their extensions (e.g., .txt, .jpg). The script either accepts a directory path as a command-line argument or prompts the user to input one if no argument is provided. It validates the input to ensure the path is a valid directory. The script excludes files without extensions and hidden files. It then generates a report that lists file extensions and their corresponding total sizes, sorted in descending order of size. Finally, the results are displayed in the console and saved to a file named disk_usage_report.txt in the current working directory.
